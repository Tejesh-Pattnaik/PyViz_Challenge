# PyViz_Challenge: San Francisco Real Estate Analysis

# Introduction

This project delves into an in-depth examination of the San Francisco real estate market, with a particular focus on housing rental data spanning from 2011 to 2016. The primary objective is to offer insights and visual representations to support a prospective one-click, purchase-and-rent strategy within the San Francisco real estate market. This analysis leverages data analysis techniques, interactive visualizations, and geospatial insights to unearth market trends and potential investment opportunities.

# Project Structure

The project unfolds in a systematic manner, with distinct phases addressing various facets of the real estate market:

1. Data Preparation: This initial phase involves the loading and cleaning of essential data sourced from CSV files, encompassing information such as annual housing statistics, neighborhood coordinates, and census data. These datasets are merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
2. Housing Units per Year: In this stage, we compute and depict the yearly count of housing units through a bar chart. This step offers insights into the overall housing unit trend during the analyzed timeframe.
3. Average Sale Prices per Square Foot: We calculate both the average sale price per square foot and identify the lowest recorded gross rent over the years. Through a line plot, we visualize the fluctuations in these prices over time, allowing us to explore the connections between sale prices and gross rent.
4. Average Sale Prices by Neighborhood: This section entails an examination of the average sale price per square foot for different neighborhoods using interactive visualizations. An interactive line plot enables users to explore diverse neighborhoods and their pricing patterns.
5. Interactive Neighborhood Map: We employ geospatial analysis to construct an interactive neighborhood map. This map showcases the relationship between sale price per square foot (represented by point size) and gross rent (indicated by color density) across various neighborhoods.
6. Data Story: The final section encapsulates the observed trends in rental income growth and sales prices. We delve into whether these trends are consistent across all neighborhoods or if there are disparities. The analysis offers insights to support potential investment strategies and recommends specific areas for consideration based on the findings.
